# Note

‼️ Important! Before you start doing tasks, create a data.json file at the path `wave-2/submissions/validator_moniker/data.json`, where `validator_moniker` is the name of your validator.</br>
In `data.json`, fill in the contents:
```
{
   validator_address: “valoper” //storyvaloper..
}
```
After that, create a PR with the name: `Information file <validator_moniker>`
After successful completion of the task, test tokens will be sent to your EVM validator address.
